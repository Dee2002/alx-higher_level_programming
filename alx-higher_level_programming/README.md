## General Info

Welcome to the Python world! In this project, you'll be working with Python programming and completing tasks that cover various aspects of the language. The initial projects are designed to be simple and straightforward, with an emphasis on understanding the basics of Python programming. As you progress, you'll encounter more advanced concepts and fun challenges.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without needing to rely on external resources:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- Creator of Python and introduction to Guido van Rossum
- Origin of the name 'Python'
- Overview of the Zen of Python philosophy
- How to use the Python interpreter
- Printing text and variables using the `print` function
- Working with strings, indexing, and slicing
- Using Pycodestyle (PEP8) for code style checking

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreter: Python 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- Your code should use Pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for style compliance
- All files must be executable

### Shell Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/bin/bash`
- All files must be executable

### C Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, with options: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should adhere to the Betty style guidelines
- No more than 5 functions per file
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in the `lists.h` header file
- All header files should be include guarded

## Zen of Python

"The Zen of Python," authored by Tim Peters, highlights the guiding principles of Python programming. Some key principles include:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- ...

(Include the full Zen of Python principles here)

## Pycodestyle

Pycodestyle is the standard style guide for Python code. It ensures consistency and readability in your codebase. Follow Pycodestyle guidelines to maintain clean and organized code.
