# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Background Context

Starting from today:

- Based on the requirements of each task, ensure to write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first before coding.
- The intranet checks for Python projects won’t be released before their first deadline to emphasize Test-Driven Development (TDD) and comprehensive case consideration.
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover all edge cases. However, the implementation should be individual.
- Always consider all possible edge cases and don’t implicitly trust user input.

## Resources

- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#module-doctest) (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#doctest.testmod)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Interactive and Non-interactive tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#what-to-test)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain without Google:

General:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What an interactive test is
- The importance of tests
- How to write Docstrings for creating tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- Basic option flags for creating tests
- Identifying edge cases effectively

## Copyright - Plagiarism

- Solutions for the tasks are to be developed independently to meet the learning objectives.
- Copy-pasting someone else's work will not fulfill the project's objectives.
- Publishing project content is prohibited.
- Plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

Python Scripts:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- File Standards: End every file with a new line.
- File Header: Start all files with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Mandatory: A README.md file at the project's root folder.
- Code Style: Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
- File Execution: All files must be executable.
- File Length: File length will be evaluated using `wc`.

Python Test Cases:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- File Standards: End all files with a new line.
- Folder Location: Store test files in a folder named 'tests'.
- File Format: Test files should be text files (.txt).
- Execution Command: Test using `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.
- Documentation Standards:
  - Modules and functions must have documentation.
  - A documentation should be a sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method. Its length will be checked.
- Collaboration on Test Cases: Working together on test cases is encouraged to cover all edge cases thoroughly – The Checker evaluates tests!
