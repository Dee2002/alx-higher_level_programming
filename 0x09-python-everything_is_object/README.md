# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

## Background Context

This project delves into understanding Python's handling of objects and explores the differences between various types of objects. It emphasizes reasoning and contemplating Python's object manipulation rather than immediate coding in the interpreter. The primary part comprises questions that ponder Python's specific behavior. The aim is to comprehend the underlying reasons behind Python's object-oriented aspects to apply the same logic to different variables and variable types.
